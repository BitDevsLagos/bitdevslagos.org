# Topics

### Journey through Bitcoin development: challenges, hurdles, wins - Mavapay founders

Moderator: [Tobechi](https://github.com/TChukwuleta)

Speakers: [Theophilus Isah](https://github.com/extheoisah), [Tobi Bamidele](https://github.com/tobi-bams)

 Theophilus and TObi walked us through how they both came into the Bitcoin space. 

 For Theophilus, right after school, he has always been excited about exploring the web3 space. 
 Curiosity led him to join the genesis cohort of BTrust Builders (formerly known as Qala). 
 Theophilus has so far worked and contributed to Bitcoin projects such as [Galoy money](https://www.galoy.io/), 
 [Chaincode](https://chaincode.com/). A lapse in Bitcoin adoption and use cases in Nigeria and Africa, led him, 
 and his team to start the [Mavapay project](http://app.mavapay.money/).

 Similar to Theophilus journey, is Tobi, who is a software engineer from the nothern part of Nigeria. 
 Tobi got introduced into Bitcoin when it was offered to him as a payment for a contract job he once did. 
 Tobi has ever since then been learning extensively of Bitcoin. He was also among the 13 selected for the 
 BTrust builders (aka. Qala) genesis cohort.  
 Ever since the cohort, Tobi has been contributing and building [Sphinx chat](https://sphinx.chat/), a decentralized
 social media organization. 2024, he joined Theophilus and now works on Mavapay in the role of CTO.
