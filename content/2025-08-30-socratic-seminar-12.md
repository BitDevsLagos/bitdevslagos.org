### Real-world Use Case of the Lightning Network through Gaming 

MC: [Tobe](https://github.com/TChukwuleta)

The Lightning Network exists to make Bitcoin payments a reality. As a Layer 2 network built on top of Bitcoin, it provides the speed and privacy needed to scale the Bitcoin network globally.

We showcased how to use Bitcoin as an in-game currency in Mario Kart. This simple use case demonstrates the possibilities of Lightning: it is fast, programmable, and can be used to transfer value globally.

During the session, a simulator launched the Mario Kart game on a PC, and participants connected their Lightning wallets to the game controllers. Throughout the gameplay, the player in first position received free sats, and the winners also received sats at the end of the game.

The event was a fun experience, and we had engaging discussions about the technical architecture powering the demonstration. As a final touch, we shared Lightning Network-themed merchandise with most attendees.
